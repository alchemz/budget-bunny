\bbsubsection{Deleting an Existing Account}{delete-account}

This screen consists of a confirmation alert dialog, activated whenever an account is about to be deleted. Deleting an account will delete all transactions related to the account, and it is an action that cannot be undone. Hence, this alert dialog exists to confirm the action. This alert can be accessed in screens where deleting an account is possible, namely: the \nameref{account} Screen and the \nameref{edit-account} Screen.
