\subsection{Currency Selection}

The currency selection screen enables users to search and select a currency to use for their new account. The user can search for the country's name, the currency name, or the currency symbol through the search bar. Once the user is satisfied with their selection, they can tap the Back button to return to the Add New Account screen, where they will see their newly selected currency in the Currency Cell (See Figure 1, Item \#4).
