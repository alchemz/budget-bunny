\bbsubsection{Deleting an Existing Account}{delete-account}

This screen consists of a confirmation alert dialog, activated whenever a budget is about to be deleted. Deleting a budget will delete all transactions related to it, and it is an action that cannot be undone. Hence, this alert dialog exists to confirm the action. This alert can be accessed in screens where deleting a budget is possible, namely: the \nameref{budget} Screen and the \nameref{edit-budget} Screen.
