\bbsubsection{Account List Display}{account}

The Account List screen displays the name and the current amount of the accounts that the user has added. It also displays a flag indicating whether or not an account has been marked as default. \newline 

It allows the user to delete an account, or set it as default by swiping the list item left. When an account item is tapped, the user is taken to a screen where the account details can be viewed and edited. Note that an account marked as default cannot be deleted, so when swiping left, the only available option is "Edit", which has the same functionality as tapping the account list item.
