## Overview

### Installation notes:

This app is still a work in progress, so it cannot be downloaded from the App Store; however, if you still want to check it out, [you can do it if you have an iOS 9 device and XCode 7+](http://bouk.co/blog/sideload-iphone/). 

### Motivation:

There are plenty of budgeting apps out there, but I'm making my own because I'd like to have full control of the features, UI, documentation, etc. I can add/subtract features when I want to. I'm also making this to scratch my own back, but if it scratches your back, then that's great.
