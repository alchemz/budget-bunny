# Budget Bunny

![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/25?title=Progress%20(v1.0)) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kieferyap/budget-bunny.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kieferyap/budget-bunny) (TO-DO: Unit-testing and code coverage emblems.)

Budget Bunny is an iOS application that helps you manage your expenses and budgets. It is currently a work in progress. 

...A painfully slow work in progress. (I realize that it's been 2 months holycrap.) Sorry about that. I currently have a full-time job, and I only have time to work on this after I get home, and I'm usually pretty tired by then. I also sometimes work on this in the weekends while I'm in the train. Still, working on this project feels relaxing (unlike *coughworkcough*), so I don't mind nibbling my way through bit by bit. Like a bunny.

## Overview

### Installation notes:

This app is still a work in progress, so it cannot be downloaded from the App Store; however, if you still want to check it out, [you can do it if you have an iOS 9 device and XCode 7+](http://bouk.co/blog/sideload-iphone/). 

### Motivation:

There are plenty of budgeting apps out there, but I'm making my own because I'd like to have full control of the features, UI, documentation, etc. I can add/subtract features when I want to. I'm also making this to scratch my own back, but if it scratches your back, then that's great.
