# Budget Bunny

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kieferyap/budget-bunny.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kieferyap/budget-bunny)

Budget Bunny is an iOS application that helps you manage your expenses and budgets. It is currently a work in progress.

-----------------------

## Overview

### Installation notes:

This app is still a work in progress, so it cannot be downloaded from the App Store; however, if you still want to check it out, [you can do it if you have an iOS 9 device and XCode 7+](http://bouk.co/blog/sideload-iphone/). 

### Motivation:

There are plenty of budgeting apps out there, but I'm making my own version because I'd like to have full control of the features, UI, documentation, etc. I can add/subtract features when I want to. It's also a good opportunity to get my feet wet on Swift, and apply what I've learned from work.
