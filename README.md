# Budget Bunny

Budget Bunny is an iOS application that helps you manage your expenses and budgets. It is currently a work in progress.

-----------------------

## Overview

### Installation notes:

I haven't enrolled in Apple's Developer Program yet (as of April 10, 2016), so this app cannot be downloaded from the App Store for now, unless you have an iOS 9 device and XCode 7+, [which enables you to load apps to your device without signing up for the Dev Program.](http://bouk.co/blog/sideload-iphone/). 

### Motivation:

There are plenty of budgeting apps out there, but I'm reinventing the wheel because I'd like to have full control of all the features, UI, documentation, etc. It's also a good opportunity to get my feet wet on Swift, and apply what I've learned in the field so far.

### Project Specification Overview:

- Xcode Version: Xcode 7.3
- Hardware: iPhone/iPad
- OS: iOS 8.1 - 9.3
